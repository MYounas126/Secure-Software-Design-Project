## Vulnerability Type: Improper Error Handling
## Vulnerability Description:
The code contains a general exception handler that catches all exceptions without providing specific handling for different types of errors. This can make it difficult to diagnose and resolve issues in the codebase as specific error types are not differentiated.

## Severity: Low
## A snippet of affected code:
```python
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred during analysis: {e}")
    return None
```

## Mitigation walkthrough:
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement specific error handling for different exception types to provide more meaningful error messages and appropriate actions based on the specific error encountered. This can help improve the overall maintainability and robustness of the codebase.

## A snippet of mitigated code:
```python
except openai.error.InvalidRequestError as e:
    print(e)
    return None
except openai.error.APIConnectionError as e:
    print(f"Error connecting to the OpenAI API: {e}")
    return None
except openai.error.AuthenticationError as e:
    print(f"Authentication error: {e}")
    return None
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred during analysis: {e}")
    return None
```

## PoC:
N/A
