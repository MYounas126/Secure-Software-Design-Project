## Vulnerability Type: Code Injection
## Vulnerability Description:
The script does not properly sanitize the input received via push options, making it vulnerable to code injection attacks. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the push options, leading to unauthorized access or execution of arbitrary commands on the server.

## Severity: High

## A snippet of affected code:
```bash
eval "value=\$GIT_PUSH_OPTION_$i"
```

## Mitigation walkthrough:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is crucial to properly sanitize and validate the input received via push options before evaluating or executing any commands based on that input. One approach is to restrict the allowed characters or patterns in the push options to prevent code injection. Additionally, consider using strict validation and filtering mechanisms to ensure that only expected and safe values are processed by the script.

## A snippet of mitigated code:
```bash
# Validate and sanitize input before processing
if [[ "$value" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9=_-]+$ ]]; then
    case "$value" in
    echoback=*)
        echo "echo from the pre-receive-hook: ${value#*=}" >&2
        ;;
    reject)
        exit 1
    esac
else
    # Log or handle invalid input
    echo "Invalid push option format: $value" >&2
fi
```

## PoC:
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious push option like `echoback=$(malicious_command)` to execute arbitrary commands on the server. The mitigated code snippet checks for invalid characters in the push option and only processes safe values, thereby preventing code injection.
