## Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
## Vulnerability Description:
The script exposes information such as the hash of the current commit (HEAD) by using the `git rev-parse` command without proper filtering or sanitization. Attackers could potentially abuse this information disclosure to infer details about the repository or the commit history.
## Severity: Medium
## A snippet of affected code:```shell
if git rev-parse --verify HEAD >/dev/null 2>&1
then
	against=HEAD
else
	# Initial commit: diff against an empty tree object
	against=$(git hash-object -t tree /dev/null)
fi
```
## Mitigation walkthrough:
To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to avoid exposing sensitive information in the script output. You can modify the script to reduce the amount of information disclosed. Additionally, consider restricting access to this script and ensuring that only authorized users can view its output.
## A snippet of mitigated code:```shell
# Use a placeholder instead of directly exposing the commit information
against=REPLACEME
```
## PoC: N/A
