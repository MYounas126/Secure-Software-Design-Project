## Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
## Vulnerability Description:
The code does not perform proper input validation on the arguments provided by the user. This can lead to various security risks such as command injection or path traversal attacks if malicious user inputs are not properly sanitized.
## Severity: Medium
## A snippet of affected code:```python
if args.url:
    print(f"Scraping JavaScript from {args.url} with recursive={args.recursive}")
    scrape_js_url(args.url, args.recursive)
```
## Mitigation walkthrough:
To mitigate this vulnerability, you should implement input validation on the user-provided arguments to ensure they are in the expected format and range. For example, you can validate the URL format, check for valid options for the 'recursive' flag, and sanitize the inputs to prevent any injection attacks. Use proper libraries or built-in functions to validate and sanitize user inputs before using them in the code.
## A snippet of mitigated code:```python
if args.url:
    if validate_url(args.url):
        print(f"Scraping JavaScript from {args.url} with recursive={args.recursive}")
        scrape_js_url(args.url, args.recursive)
    else:
        print("Invalid URL provided.")
```
## PoC:
This is how you can validate the URL before processing it further.
