## Vulnerability Type: Command Injection
## Vulnerability Description:
The script allows for command injection by passing arguments directly to the `exec` function without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker could potentially craft malicious input to execute arbitrary commands on the system.
## Severity: High
## A snippet of affected code:```bash
test -x "$precommit" && exec "$precommit" ${1+"$@"}
```
## Mitigation walkthrough:
To mitigate the command injection vulnerability, you should refrain from directly passing unvalidated user input to the `exec` function. Instead, you should sanitize and validate input before using it. One approach is to use a whitelist approach to only allow known safe input.
## A snippet of mitigated code:```bash
# Validate $1 argument before executing
if [ "$1" = "safe_input" ]; then
    test -x "$precommit" && exec "$precommit" ${1+"$@"}
else
    echo "Invalid input. Exiting."
    exit 1
fi
```
## PoC:
```bash
./script.sh ; date # Injecting a command after the original script execution
```
