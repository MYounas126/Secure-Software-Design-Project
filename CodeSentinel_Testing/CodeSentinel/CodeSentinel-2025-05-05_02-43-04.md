This code snippet appears to be a part of a larger application that analyzes either a GitHub URL or an uploaded file and displays the analysis results to the user. 

I will focus on potential security vulnerabilities and provide recommendations to improve the code's security posture.

Here are some security-related concerns:

## Vulnerability Type: Directory Traversal
## Vulnerability Description:
The code generates a file path based on the input URL without proper validation, which could potentially lead to directory traversal attacks.
## Severity: Medium
## A snippet of affected code:
```python
report_path = f"report/{url.split('/')[-1].replace('.git', '')}" if 'http' in url else f"report/{os.path.basename(url)}"
```
## Mitigation walkthrough:
Ensure proper input validation for the URL before constructing the file path. Validate that the URL is from a trusted source and sanitize it to prevent directory traversal attacks.
## A snippet of mitigated code:
```python
# Validate and sanitize the URL before constructing the file path
clean_url = sanitize_input(url)  # Implement a function to sanitize input
report_path = f"report/{clean_url.split('/')[-1].replace('.git', '')}" if 'http' in clean_url else f"report/{os.path.basename(clean_url)}"
```
## PoC:
An attacker could potentially craft a malicious URL to perform directory traversal and access sensitive files on the server.

Please continue reviewing the code for additional security vulnerabilities and provide appropriate recommendations for mitigation.
