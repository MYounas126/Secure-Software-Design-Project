## Vulnerability Type:
Information Disclosure

## Vulnerability Description:
The provided code snippet reveals the internal logic and workflow of a Git repository, potentially sharing sensitive information about the branches and their status. This could allow an attacker to gain insight into the structure of the repository and potentially exploit it for malicious purposes.

## Severity:
Low

## A snippet of affected code:
```
o "next"
  /       /           /           /
 /   a---a---b A     /           /
/   /               /           /
/   /   c---c---c---c B         /
/   /   /             \         /
/   /   /   b---b C     \       /
/   /   /   /             \     /
---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"
```

## Mitigation walkthrough:
To mitigate this information disclosure vulnerability, it is recommended to avoid sharing detailed internal workflow diagrams or sensitive information about the Git repository's branches in public or untrusted environments. Git users should be cautious about revealing too much information that could be misused by potential attackers.

## A snippet of mitigated code:
Incomplete branching diagram:

```
o "next"
  /       /           /           /
 /   a---a---b A     /           /
/   /               /           /
/   /   c---c---c---c B         /
/   /   /             \         /
/   /   /   b---b C     \       /
```

## PoC:
N/A
