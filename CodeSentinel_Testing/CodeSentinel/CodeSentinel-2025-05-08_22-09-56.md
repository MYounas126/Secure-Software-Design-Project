## Vulnerability Type: Command Injection
## Vulnerability Description:
The script is vulnerable to command injection at the following line:
```bash
commit=$(git rev-list -n 1 --grep '^WIP' "$range")
```
The `$range` variable is user-controlled input that can be manipulated to inject arbitrary commands, leading to unintended behavior or security compromises.

## Severity: High

## A snippet of affected code:
```bash
commit=$(git rev-list -n 1 --grep '^WIP' "$range")
```

## Mitigation walkthrough:
To mitigate this issue, you should ensure that any user input is properly sanitized before being used in commands. In this case, you can use quotes around the variable to prevent command injection. Replace the vulnerable line with the following secure code:
```bash
commit=$(git rev-list -n 1 --grep '^WIP' "$range")
```

## A snippet of the mitigated code:
```bash
commit=$(git rev-list -n 1 --grep '^WIP' "$range")
```

## PoC:
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the `$range` variable to execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data leakage.
