## Vulnerability Type:
Improper input validation

## Vulnerability Description:
The code snippet shown does not perform proper input validation on the value of variable "$1" before using it with the "grep" and "test" commands. This could lead to command injection vulnerabilities if an attacker is able to control the value of "$1".

## Severity:
High

## A snippet of affected code:
```bash
if grep -q "^diff --git " "$1"
then
	validate_patch "$1"
else
	validate_cover_letter "$1"
fi &&

if test "$GIT_SENDEMAIL_FILE_COUNTER" = "$GIT_SENDEMAIL_FILE_TOTAL"
then
	git config --unset-all sendemail.validateWorktree &&
	trap 'git worktree remove -ff "$worktree"' EXIT &&
	validate_series
fi
```

## Mitigation walkthrough:
Proper input validation should be performed on the value of "$1" before using it in the commands. This can be done by checking if the variable is set and ensuring it contains valid data before proceeding with the "grep" and "test" commands.

## A snippet of mitigated code:
```bash
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Error: Missing input argument"
    exit 1
fi

if grep -q "^diff --git " "$1"
then
    validate_patch "$1"
else
    validate_cover_letter "$1"
fi &&

if [ "$GIT_SENDEMAIL_FILE_COUNTER" = "$GIT_SENDEMAIL_FILE_TOTAL" ]
then
    git config --unset-all sendemail.validateWorktree &&
    trap 'git worktree remove -ff "$worktree"' EXIT &&
    validate_series
fi
```

## PoC:
N/A
