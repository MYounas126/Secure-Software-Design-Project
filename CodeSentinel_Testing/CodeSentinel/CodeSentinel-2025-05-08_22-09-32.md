## Vulnerability Type: Command Injection
## Vulnerability Description:
The script blindly executes the contents of the `$commitmsg` variable using the `exec` function without properly sanitizing the input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands through the `commitmsg` file and potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of the script. This can lead to serious security implications, such as unauthorized access, data loss, or other detrimental actions.
## Severity: High
## A snippet of affected code:```test -x "$commitmsg" && exec "$commitmsg" ${1+"$@"}```
## Mitigation walkthrough:
To mitigate the command injection vulnerability, it is essential to sanitize the input from the `$commitmsg` file before executing it. One way to address this issue is to validate the content of the file and ensure that it contains only expected and safe input. This can be achieved by implementing proper input validation and sanitization techniques, such as filtering out any special characters or executing the command in a more controlled environment, like a Docker container.
## A snippet of mitigated code:```test -x "$commitmsg" && exec sh -c "$(cat $commitmsg)"```
## PoC:
An example of how an attacker can exploit this vulnerability is by creating a malicious `commit-msg` script with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Malicious command executed"
ls -la
```

If the attacker manages to replace the original `commit-msg` script with the above code, the script will execute the `ls -la` command when the hook is triggered, leading to potential unauthorized actions.
