## Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
## Vulnerability Description:
The code imports modules and libraries without any protection, which exposes sensitive information such as directory structure and file paths.

## Severity: Medium
## A snippet of affected code:
```python
from . import codeReviewAi
from . import gitCode
from scrapers import scrape_js_sync
```

## Mitigation walkthrough:
To mitigate this vulnerability, avoid direct importing of modules that reveal sensitive information. Instead, consider using aliases or abstracting imports to prevent disclosure of internal structure. It's crucial to implement proper access controls to limit information exposure.

## A snippet of mitigated code:
```python
from safe_module import codeReviewAi as safeCodeReviewAi
from safe_module import gitCode as safeGitCode
from safe_scraper_module import scrape_js_sync as safeScrapeJsSync
```
