## Vulnerability Type: Lack of Path Sanitization
## Vulnerability Description:
The code does not perform proper path and directory sanitization when performing operations on the working tree. This could potentially lead to path traversal attacks or unintended manipulation of files in the filesystem.
## Severity: Medium
## A snippet of affected code:```
	if ! git read-tree -u -m "$commit"
then
	die "Could not update working tree to new HEAD"
fi
```
## Mitigation walkthrough:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to sanitize the $commit variable to ensure it only contains a valid commit hash or reference. Additionally, consider using relative paths or ensuring that absolute paths are within the scope of the working directory to prevent any unintended filesystem manipulation. Here is an example mitigation approach:
```bash
# Sanitize the $commit variable
if [[ $commit =~ ^[0-9a-f]{40}$ ]]; then
    if ! git read-tree -u -m "$commit"
    then
        die "Could not update working tree to new HEAD"
    fi
else
    die "Invalid commit hash"
fi
```
## A snippet of mitigated code:```
if [[ $commit =~ ^[0-9a-f]{40}$ ]]; then
	if ! git read-tree -u -m "$commit"
then
	die "Could not update working tree to new HEAD"
fi
else
	die "Invalid commit hash"
fi
```
## PoC: N/A
