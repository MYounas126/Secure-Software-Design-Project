## Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure
## Vulnerability Description:
The code snippet contains logging statements that may reveal sensitive information such as error messages or API responses. This could potentially leak critical information to an attacker in a production environment.
## Severity: Medium
## A snippet of affected code:
```python
logging.error(f"Invalid request error: {e}")
logging.error(f"Rate limit exceeded: {e}")
logging.error(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```
## Mitigation walkthrough:
To mitigate this issue, ensure that sensitive information is not logged in production environments. Instead, log only necessary information or use different log levels for different types of information. For example, logging errors or exceptions can be useful for debugging but should not reveal sensitive information. Also, consider using structured logging to avoid exposing sensitive data accidentally.
## A snippet of mitigated code:
```python
logging.error("An error occurred while processing the request.")
logging.error("The rate limit has been exceeded.")
logging.error("An unexpected error occurred.")
```
## PoC:
N/A
