### Vulnerability Type:
Hardcoded credentials

### Vulnerability Description:
The code contains a potential vulnerability where credentials are hardcoded in the code, which poses a security risk as these credentials can be easily exposed and exploited by attackers.

### Severity:
High

### A snippet of affected code:
```python
# Hardcoded credentials
github_username = 'your_username'
github_token = 'your_token'
```

### Mitigation walkthrough:
To address this vulnerability, you should avoid hardcoding credentials in the source code. Instead, consider using environment variables or a secure configuration file to store and retrieve sensitive information such as credentials. This helps protect the credentials from being easily exposed.

### A snippet of mitigated code:
```python
# Secure handling of credentials
import os

github_username = os.getenv('GITHUB_USERNAME')
github_token = os.getenv('GITHUB_TOKEN')
```

### PoC:
Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the GitHub credentials are hardcoded in the source code, which poses a security risk. These credentials can be easily exposed and abused by attackers. It is recommended to store sensitive information like credentials in a secure manner to ensure the security of the application.
