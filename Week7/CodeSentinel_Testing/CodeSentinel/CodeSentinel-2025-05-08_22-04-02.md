## Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
## Vulnerability Description:
The code does not perform input validation on the provided arguments before executing the corresponding functionality. This can lead to potential security issues such as command injection or unexpected behavior due to malformed input.
## Severity: Medium
## A snippet of affected code:
```python
if args.url:
    print(f"Scraping GitHub page from {args.url}")
    scrape_github_sync(args.url, args.recursive)
```
## Mitigation walkthrough:
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to perform input validation on the provided arguments before executing any functionality. This involves checking the input parameters for expected format, data type, and range to ensure they meet the application's requirements. In this case, you can validate the URL format, check for null values, and sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks.
## A snippet of mitigated code:
```python
if args.url:
    if not args.url.startswith("https://github.com/"):
        print("Please provide a valid GitHub URL starting with 'https://github.com/'.")
        sys.exit(1)
    print(f"Scraping GitHub page from {args.url}")
    scrape_github_sync(args.url, args.recursive)
```
## PoC: N/A
