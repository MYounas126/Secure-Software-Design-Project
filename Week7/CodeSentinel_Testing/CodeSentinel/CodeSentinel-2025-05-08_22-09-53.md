## Vulnerability Type: Code Execution
## Vulnerability Description:
The script blindly executes the pre-commit hook without proper validation, potentially allowing an attacker to insert arbitrary commands into the `pre-commit` hook script. This could lead to code execution or other malicious actions during the merge commit process.

## Severity: High

## A snippet of affected code:
```sh
test -x "$GIT_DIR/hooks/pre-commit" &&
        exec "$GIT_DIR/hooks/pre-commit"
```

## Mitigation walkthrough:
To mitigate this vulnerability, you should ensure that the execution of the `pre-commit` script is controlled and only authorized scripts are executed. You can implement stricter validation and explicitly specify the path to the authorized pre-commit hook script before executing it.

Modify the script as follows:
```sh
# Validate pre-commit script path
PRE_COMMIT_SCRIPT="$GIT_DIR/hooks/pre-commit"
if [ -x "$PRE_COMMIT_SCRIPT" ]; then
    exec "$PRE_COMMIT_SCRIPT"
else
    echo "Error: Unauthorized pre-commit script or missing script."
    exit 1
fi
```

## A snippet of mitigated code:
```sh
# Validate pre-commit script path
PRE_COMMIT_SCRIPT="$GIT_DIR/hooks/pre-commit"
if [ -x "$PRE_COMMIT_SCRIPT" ]; then
    exec "$PRE_COMMIT_SCRIPT"
else
    echo "Error: Unauthorized pre-commit script or missing script."
    exit 1
fi
```

## PoC:
An attacker could create a malicious `pre-commit` script with arbitrary commands and place it in the `hooks` directory. When the vulnerable script is executed, the attacker's malicious code will also run, potentially leading to code execution or other unauthorized actions.
