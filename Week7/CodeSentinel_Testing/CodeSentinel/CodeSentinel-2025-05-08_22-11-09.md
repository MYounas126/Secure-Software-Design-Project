## Vulnerability Type: Lack of Input Validation
## Vulnerability Description:
The `scrape_js_sync` function does not perform any input validation on the `url` parameter. This lack of input validation can lead to various security issues such as command injection, path traversal, or other types of attacks if the input is not sanitized properly.
## Severity: Medium
## A snippet of affected code:```python
def scrape_js_sync(url, recursive=False):
    # Your scraping logic here
    print(f"Scraping JavaScript from {url} with recursive={recursive}")
```
## Mitigation walkthrough:
To mitigate this vulnerability, you should implement input validation to ensure that the `url` parameter is safe to use. You can validate the URL format, sanitize input to prevent injection attacks, and restrict access to only allowed domains if necessary. Here's an example of how you can implement basic input validation for the `url` parameter:

```python
import re

def scrape_js_sync(url, recursive=False):
    # Input validation for URL
    if not re.match(r'^https?://(?:www\.)?[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\+~#=]{2,256}\.[a-z]{2,6}\b([-a-zA-Z0-9@:%_\+.~#?&//=]*)$', url):
        raise ValueError('Invalid URL format')

    # Your scraping logic here
    print(f"Scraping JavaScript from {url} with recursive={recursive}")
```

In this example, a regular expression is used to validate the format of the URL. You can adjust the regex pattern as needed based on your specific requirements. Remember to sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks and always validate input data before using it in any critical operations.
