## Vulnerability Type: Code Injection
## Vulnerability Description:
The script uses user input (COMMIT_MSG_FILE) without proper sanitization, which could potentially lead to code injection vulnerabilities if malicious input is provided.
## Severity: High
## A snippet of affected code:```/usr/bin/perl -i.bak -ne 'print unless(m/^. Please enter the commit message/..m/^#$/)' "$COMMIT_MSG_FILE"```
## Mitigation walkthrough:
To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure that the user input (COMMIT_MSG_FILE) is properly sanitized to prevent code injection. One approach is to validate the input file path and ensure that it only includes expected characters before processing it in the Perl command.
## A snippet of mitigated code:```COMMIT_MSG_FILE=$(realpath --relative-to=. "$1")```
## PoC: N/A
