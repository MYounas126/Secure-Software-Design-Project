## Vulnerability Type: Error Handling Issue
## Vulnerability Description:
The code catches all exceptions with a broad `except Exception` block, which may mask specific types of errors and make it harder to troubleshoot issues. It is recommended to catch specific exception types to handle different error scenarios appropriately.
## Severity: Low
## A snippet of affected code:
```python
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```
## Mitigation walkthrough:
Update the exception handling to catch specific exception types to handle different error scenarios appropriately. For example:
```python
except openai.error.InvalidRequestError as e:
    logging.error(f"Invalid request error: {e}")
except openai.error.RateLimitError as e:
    logging.error(f"Rate limit exceeded: {e}")
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("\nApplication interrupted by user. Exiting...")
    sys.exit()
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```
## PoC: N/A
