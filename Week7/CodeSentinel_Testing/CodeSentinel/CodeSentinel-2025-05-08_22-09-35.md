## Vulnerability Type: Code Injection
## Vulnerability Description:
The script is vulnerable to code injection through the commit message file. The script executes the commit message file without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code that could be executed when the script runs. This can lead to arbitrary code execution and unauthorized access to the system.

## Severity: High

## A snippet of affected code:```test "" = "$(grep '^Signed-off-by: ' "$1" |
	 sort | uniq -c | sed -e '/^[ 	]*1[ 	]/d')" || {
	echo >&2 Duplicate Signed-off-by lines.
	exit 1
}```

## Mitigation walkthrough:
To mitigate this vulnerability, you should validate and sanitize user input before executing it. Ensure that the commit message file contents are properly sanitized to prevent code injection. Specifically, use proper input validation and filtering techniques to ensure that only safe and expected content is processed by the script. Avoid executing user-supplied content directly within the script.

## A snippet of mitigated code:```test "" = "$(grep '^Signed-off-by: ' "$1" |
	 sort | uniq -c | sed -e '/^[ 	]*1[ 	]/d' | grep -E "^[a-zA-Z0-9 ]+$")" || {
	echo >&2 Duplicate Signed-off-by lines.
	exit 1
}```

## PoC:
An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the commit message file that could be executed by the script, leading to unauthorized actions or system compromise.
