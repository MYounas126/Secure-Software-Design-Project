## Vulnerability Type: Code Injection
## Vulnerability Description:
The importing of modules using relative paths can introduce security risks like code injection if the path is not properly validated. An attacker could potentially manipulate the module loading process to execute arbitrary code or gain unauthorized access to resources.
## Severity: High
## A snippet of affected code:
```python
from .js_scraper import scrape_js_sync
```
## Mitigation walkthrough:
To mitigate this vulnerability, ensure that the path for importing modules is validated to prevent any user-controlled or malicious inputs. Use absolute paths instead of relative paths to import modules, which reduces the risk of path traversal attacks. Perform input validation and consider restricting module imports to a specific directory if possible.
## PoC:
```python
from safe_directory.js_scraper import scrape_js_sync
```
