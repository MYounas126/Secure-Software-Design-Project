## Vulnerability Type: Path Traversal
## Vulnerability Description:
The `report_path` variable is constructed based on the URL provided and is vulnerable to path traversal attacks. An attacker may manipulate the URL input to traverse directories and access sensitive files on the system. This can lead to unauthorized disclosure of data or execution of malicious actions.

## Severity: High

## A snippet of affected code:
```python
report_path = f"report/{url.split('/')[-1].replace('.git', '')}" if 'http' in url else f"report/{os.path.basename(url)}"
```

## Mitigation walkthrough:
To mitigate the path traversal vulnerability, it is recommended to restrict access to specific directories only. You can achieve this by validating and sanitizing the input URL and ensuring that it points to a legitimate report directory. It is better to use a whitelist approach to allow only specific characters or directories in the URL.

Here's how you can mitigate:

1. Validate the URL input to ensure it is a legitimate GitHub URL.
2. Use a safe method to construct the `report_path` variable, avoiding directory traversal.
3. Implement proper access controls to restrict access to sensitive directories.

## A snippet of mitigated code:
```python
# Validate the URL input
if is_valid_github_url(url):
    report_dir = os.path.basename(url) if 'http' in url else ''  # Get the directory name
    report_path = os.path.join("report", report_dir)
``` 

## PoC:
An attacker can potentially craft a malicious URL to traverse directories and access sensitive files:

```
https://example.com/../../../etc/passwd
```
