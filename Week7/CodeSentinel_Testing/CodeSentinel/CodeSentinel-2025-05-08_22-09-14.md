## Vulnerability Type: Path Traversal
## Vulnerability Description:
The code constructs a file path based on user input without proper validation, which may lead to a path traversal vulnerability. An attacker could potentially read sensitive files on the server by manipulating the `url` parameter.
## Severity: High
## A snippet of affected code:
```python
report_path = f"report/{url.split('/')[-1].replace('.git', '')}" if 'http' in url else f"report/{os.path.basename(url)}"
```
## Mitigation walkthrough:
To mitigate path traversal vulnerabilities, ensure that user-supplied input used to construct file paths is properly validated and sanitized. You can implement input validation to restrict the input to a whitelist of allowed characters and prevent directory traversal sequences such as "../". Additionally, consider using a library function to resolve the file path safely.
## A snippet of mitigated code:
```python
# Constructing a safe report path
if 'http' in url:
    report_filename = url.split('/')[-1].replace('.git', '')
else:
    report_filename = os.path.basename(url)
report_path = os.path.join("report", report_filename)
```
## PoC:
An attacker could supply a malicious `url` parameter such as `http://example.com/../../etc/passwd`, which could lead to a path traversal attack and potentially allow access to sensitive system files.
