## Vulnerability Type: Path Traversal
## Vulnerability Description:
The code constructs a file path using user-controlled input (`url`) without proper validation. This can potentially lead to a path traversal attack, where an attacker could manipulate the URL input to access files outside the intended directory, leading to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.
## Severity: High
## A snippet of affected code:
```python
report_path = f"report/{url.split('/')[-1].replace('.git', '')}" if 'http' in url else f"report/{os.path.basename(url)}"
```
## Mitigation walkthrough:
To mitigate the path traversal vulnerability, you should implement proper validation and sanitization of the user input (`url`) before constructing the file path. You can use techniques such as whitelisting allowed characters and directories, and using secure API functions for path manipulation.

Here's an example of how you can mitigate the vulnerability by validating the input:
```python
# Validate the URL before constructing the file path
if 'http' in url:
    url_components = url.split('/')
    if len(url_components) > 2:  # Ensure the URL has the necessary components
        repo_name = url_components[-1].replace('.git', '')
        report_path = f"report/{repo_name}"
    else:
        # Handle invalid URL input appropriately
        st.warning('Invalid GitHub URL provided.')
else:
    # Handle non-HTTP URLs appropriately
    # You can add further validation logic for local file paths if needed
    st.warning('Invalid URL provided.')
```
## PoC:
An example of a path traversal attack with a crafted input like `http://example.com/../../../../../etc/passwd` could lead to accessing sensitive system files. Implement the mitigation to prevent such attacks.
