## Vulnerability Type: Command Injection
## Vulnerability Description:
The use of `die` with interpolated variables potentially leads to command injection vulnerabilities. An attacker could manipulate the `$error` variable to inject malicious commands which may get executed within the system context.
## Severity: High
## A snippet of affected code:```perl
die "Watchman: $error.\n" .
"Falling back to scanning...\n" if $error;
```
## Mitigation walkthrough:
To mitigate command injection vulnerabilities, you should avoid interpolating variables directly into system commands. Instead, use proper sanitization techniques like quoting or escaping. In this case, rather than directly interpolating `$error`, you can concatenate the error string to prevent command injection. Below is an example of the code after mitigation:
```perl
die "Watchman: " . $error . ".\n" .
"Falling back to scanning...\n" if $error;
```
## A snippet of mitigated code:```perl
if ($error) {
    die "Watchman: " . $error . ".\n" .
    "Falling back to scanning...\n";
}
```
## PoC: N/A
